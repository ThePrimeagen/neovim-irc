## Things to do
* MESSAGES: Clean up the print statements such that I can control the type of
  output.  This would go obviously really nice for the YT video (getting pwn'd
  with segfaults and the likes).

* If you provide a user name that is not yours, kick em

* If you provide a server that is not irc.theprimeagen.tv, kick em

* PINGS and PONGS are not implemented.
